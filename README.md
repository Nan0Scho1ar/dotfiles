# dotfiles
Nan0scho1ar's public dotfiles.

After many years of procrastination, I have finally reduced the 1600+ files in my private dotfiles repo to something sane for public consumption. Some parts of this setup won't work in isolation as they depend on my [core](https://github.com/Nan0Scho1ar/n0s1.core) repo, or in some cases even my (yet to be made public) scripts repo. There is still some good stuff in here worth pinching though.
